A \\emph{push} $\\term{[x];M}$ corresponds to an application $\\term{M\\,x}$, restricted to first order by forcing the argument to be a variable. The stack machine is then a simplified Krivine machine~\\cite{krivine_call-by-name_2007}, replacing environments with substitution. This highlights a key aspect. A $\\kappa$-abstraction is a \\emph{binder}, making the variable $x$ \\emph{local} to $\\kappa x.M$. However, \\emph{binding} and \\emph{variable scope} are the main notions that will need to be re-visited in light of duality. A pop $\\term{<x>}$ is therefore not a binder, and variables in this fragment of the RMC are \\emph{global}. This does not prevent us from encoding first-order $\\lambda$-calculus: in the first-order setting, terms are never duplicated, removing any issues with variable capture or $\\alpha$-conversion. We may then simulate binding by stipulating that each \\emph{pop} $\\term{<x>}$ has a unique variable, which only occurs in \\emph{pushes} to its right (this is \\emph{Barendregt\'s convention}). Later, when duplication of terms returns, we will re-introduce local variable scope with a binding \\emph{new variable} construct $\\term{Ex.M}$,  justifying the core fragment of the RMC as a decomposition of abstraction into its two distinct roles: \\emph{pop} and \\emph{new}. \n\n\n% Duality\n%\n\\paragraph{Duality}\n%\nOur formulation of first-order $\\lambda$-calculus is tailored to reveal its latent duality, effected simply by reversing a term while switching \\emph{push} and \\emph{pop}. The dual of our previous example term:\n\\[\n\t\\term{<y>;<z>;<x>;[z];[y];[x]~: 3 > 3}~.\n\\]\nThe linear fragment, where terms represent \\emph{permutations}, is closed under duality. By contrast, the \\emph{non-linear} first-order $\\lambda$-calculus is characterised by \\emph{duplication} and \\emph{deletion}, embodied by the \\emph{diagonal} and \\emph{terminal} below left. These yield the dual terms below right, which we label \\emph{matching} and \\emph{arbitrary}, that feature multiple related \\emph{pops}, or zero.\n\\[\n\t\\tikzfig{figures/Frobenius-intro}\n\\]\nSemantics tells us that the new terms should represent the relational converse of the diagonal and terminal functions, given respectively by the partial function that sends $(x,x)$ to $x$ and is otherwise undefined,  and the non-deterministic function sending the trivial input to all possible outputs.  \n\nOperationally, the required behaviour of \\emph{matching} $\\term{<x>;<x>;[x]}$ for an input stack of two identical values, $\\val c\\,\\val c$, is to return $\\val c$,  and for distinct values, $\\val d\\,\\val c$, is to fail. We achieve this by generalising \\emph{pop} to hold also \\emph{constants}, $\\term{<c>}$, interpreted as an \\emph{assertion} that the head of the stack is $\\val c$,  with failure for any other constant. Then $\\term{<x>;<x>;[x]}$ evaluates by first popping $\\val c$, substituting it for $\\val x$ in both \\emph{pop} and \\emph{push} to get $\\term{<c>;[c]}$, which then pops and replaces the second value $\\val c$ (or fails for $\\val d$). \n\nThe second term, \\emph{arbitrary} $\\term{[x]}$, illustrates that stack values must include variables, and hence must be substituted for: the term $\\term{<c>}$ for a stack $\\val x\\,\\val x$ incurs a substitution of $\\val c$ for the second $\\val x$. The behaviour of \\emph{push} and \\emph{pop} thus becomes perfectly symmetric, with substitutions in both the stack and the remaining term.\n\nAltogether these relations are abstracted categorically as \\emph{Frobenius monoids},  which we take to capture non-linear computation in the presence of duality,  given in string diagrams as above and satisfied by the \\emph{Frobenius equation} below.\n\\[\n\t\\tikzfig{figures/Frobenius-Equation-only}\n\\]\nIntuitively, this implements the idea that \\emph{connectivity = identity}: connected wires represent a single value. In our calculus, this is modeled by \\emph{variable names}; and indeed the three diagrams in the above equation may all be represented by the term $\\term{<x>;<x>;[x];[x]}$.\n\nFrobenius monoids have received a huge amount of interest over the last decade or so,  since they were identified as a fundamental primitive of quantum computation by the ZX-calculus  \\cite{coecke_interacting_2011, coecke_new_2013, Perdrix:completeness-ZX}.  Since then,  they have been adopted as primitives in a wide range of string diagrammatic languages,  including those capturing conjunctive queries,  relational algebra,  and aspects of logic programming \n\\cite{Bonchi:graphical-conjunctive-queries,bonchi:tape-diagrams, zanasi:logic-programming,  bonchi_graphical_2019}.  In programming language theory specifically,  they have received significantly less attention,  but have been used in a synthetic axiomatization of the operation of \\emph{exact conditioning} in probabilistic programming \\cite{di_lavore_evidential_2023, Staton:exact-conditioning} and to model the (partial) inverse of duplication in reversible languages \\cite{kaarsgaard_join_2021}.  The RMC offers a novel \\emph{operational} account of Frobenius monoids,  thus filling a gap in the literature and bridging the study of string-diagrammatic and programming languages.\n\n\n% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The full calculus\n\n\\subsection{The full calculus}\n\nThe calculus thus far is generated by: \\emph{push} $\\term{[x]}$ and \\emph{pop} $\\term{<x>}$ operations, \\emph{sequential composition} $\\term{M;N}$, and its unit $\\term{*}$, the imperative \\emph{skip}. Associativity of composition will be implemented via the machine and the equational theory. To reach our desired expressivity, we extend this with a careful selection of features, outlined below.\n\n\n% Unification\n%\n\\paragraph{Algebraic terms and unification}\n%\nThe $\\beta$-reduction relation is the interaction of a consecutive \\emph{push} and \\emph{pop}, say $\\term{[y];<x>}$, to incur a (global) substitution $\\term{\\{y/x\\}}$. With constants, both $\\term{[c];<x>}$ and $\\term{[x];<c>}$ incur $\\term{\\{c/x\\}}$, while $\\term{[c];<c>}$ succeeds $(\\term *)$ and $\\term{[d];<c>}$ fails. \n\nViewing a redex as a formal equation, these are the familiar rules of \\emph{first-order unification},  restricted to variables and constants. We generalize our calculus to allow \\emph{algebraic terms}\\footnote{We write "algebraic terms" to avoid name clashing with "first-order terms",  which here refer to terms of the RMC,  in contrast with "higher-order terms" of the $\\lambda$-calculus.} as values, and will implement unification on the machine and through a symmetric version of $\\beta$-reduction.  \nEvaluating a redex $\\term{[t];<s>}$ will thus produce substitutions constituting the most general unifier of $\\val t$ and $\\val s$, or fail if none exists.  \n\n\n% Kleene algebra\n%\n\\paragraph{Kleene Algebra}\n%\nTo internalize the partial and non-deterministic semantics of relations,  we introduce non-deterministic \\emph{sum} $(\\term+)$ and \\emph{failure} $(\\term{0})$,  its unit.  Indeed,  the presence of non-determinism is often considered a defining feature of relational programming. With sequencing already present,  we also desire a Kleene star construction $(\\term{-^*})$ to model infinitary behaviour,  \\textit{e.g.},  of logic programming.  Our full calculus will thus be conservative over Kleene algebra (KA).  \n\nThe atoms of KA may be interpreted as programs,  with the axioms of KA acting as a set of (weak) fundamental laws any standard non-deterministic,  sequential language should satisfy~\\cite{hoare_complete_1987,Hoare:laws-of-programming,Kozen:KAT}.  However,  an \\emph{operational} interpretation of KA is typically only given via its correspondence with finite state automata.  Our calculus can be viewed as a modification of KA to include the dual primitives of \\emph{push} and \\emph{pop},   replacing the atoms of KA and supporting its extension with a \\emph{direct} operational semantics.  \n\n\n% Local variables\n%\n\\paragraph{Local variables}\n%\nEvaluation for Kleene star, taking a term $\\term{M^*}$ non-deterministically to a sequence $\\term{M;\\dots;M}$ of any length, re-introduces duplication of terms into the calculus, bringing with it the familiar problems of variable identity and $\\alpha$-conversion.  We adopt a standard solution: making the scope of a variable explicit with a \\emph{new variable} construct,  $\\term{Ex.M}$,  familiar variously from nominal Kleene algebra \\cite{Gabbay:nominal-KA},  functional logic programming \\cite{hanus_functional_2013},  $\\pi$-calculus \\cite{Milner:pi-calculus},  and the $\\nu$-calculus \\cite{Pitts:nu-calculus} as a fragment of ML.  This restores locality and gives a proper decomposition of $\\kappa$-abstraction into its two roles: first, as the binder of new variables,  and second, as an instruction to \\emph{pop} from the stack.\n\\[\n\t\\term{\\kappa x.M} ~=~ \\term{Ex.(<x>;M)}\n\\]\n\n\n% Locations\n%\n\\paragraph{Locations} \n%\nWe inherit a further feature from the Functional Machine Calculus: multiple stacks (or streams) on the abstract machine, indexed in a set of \\emph{locations}. This captures several computational effects: mutable store, as stacks restricted to depth one; input and output, as dedicated streams; and a probabilistic generator, as a stream of random bits --- remarkably,  \\emph{while retaining confluent reduction}~\\cite{Heijltjes:FMCI}. The required generalization of the syntax is a simple parameterization of \\emph{push} and \\emph{pop} in a location $ a$, as $\\term{[x]a}$ and $\\term{a<x>}$ respectively, to operate on the indicated stack.  Thereby,  the RMC subsumes the operational semantics of the given effects, while $\\beta\\eta$-equivalence captures their algebraic theory~\\cite{Heijltjes:FMCI, Heijltjes:FMCII}.  This extension allows the simple modelling of stateful models of computation such as Turing machines and Petri nets.\n\n%------------------------------------------------------------ THE RELATIONAL MACHINE CALCULUS\n\n\\section{The Relational Machine Calculus}\n\\label{sec:RMC}\n\nWe define the \\emph{Relational Machine Calculus} (RMC) as follows. We assume a countable set of \\emph{locations} ${A}=\\{a,b,c\\dots\\}$, which each represent a stack on the abstract machine. Stacks hold algebraic terms over a signature $\\Sigma$ of function symbols $f^n$ of arity $n$.\n\n\\begin{definition}[Relational Machine Calculus]\n\\emph{Values} $\\val{s,t}$ and \\emph{(computation) terms} $\\term{M,N}$ are given by the grammars below.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{@{}rrll@{}}\n\t\\val{s,t} &\\Coloneqq&\n\t\t\t\\val{x}\n\t~\\mid~\t\\val{f^n(t_1,\\dots,t_n)} \\quad (\\val{f^n}\\in\\Sigma) & \\text{algebraic terms}\n\\\\ \\\\\n\t\\term{M,N} &\\Coloneqq&\n\t\t\t\\term{*}\n\t~\\mid~\t\\term{M;N}\n\t~\\mid~\t\\term{M^*}\n\t~\\mid~\t\\term{0}\n\t~\\mid~\t\\term{M + N} & \\text{Kleene algebra}\n\\\\[5pt]\n\t&\\mid&  \\term{[t]a}\n\t~\\mid~\t\\term{a<t>}  & \\text{stack operations}\n\\\\[5pt]\n\t&\\mid&\t\\term{Ex.M}\t & \\text{variable scope}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\\end{definition}\n\nFrom left to right, the computation terms are \\emph{skip} or \\emph{nil} $\\term*$, \\emph{(sequential) composition}  $\\term{M;N}$, \\emph{Kleene star} $\\term{M^*}$, \\emph{zero} or \\emph{failure} $\\term 0$, a \\emph{sum} of terms $\\term{M+N}$, a \\emph{push} $\\term{[t]a}$ of the value $\\val t$ to the location $a$, a \\emph{pop} $\\term{a<t>}$ from the location $a$ to unify with $\\val t$, and a \\emph{new} variable introduction $\\term{Ex.M}$ which binds $x$ in $\\term M$. Operator precedence: Kleene star binds tightest, then sequencing, then \\emph{new} $\\term{Ex.M}$, and finally sum; then $\\term{Ex.M;N + P;Q^*}=\\term{(Ex.(M;N)) + (P;(Q^*))}$.  We often omit the superscript on $f^n$. \n\nThe calculus exhibits \\emph{duality} as a syntactic involution.\n  \n\\begin{definition}[Duality]\nDefine \\emph{duality} $(-)^\\dagger$ on terms as follows. \n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\t      \\term{*}^\\dagger &=& \\term{*} \n\\\\\t  (\\term{N;M})^\\dagger &=& \\term{M}^\\dagger\\term{;}\\term{N}^\\dagger\n\\\\\t  (\\term{M^*})^\\dagger &=& \\term{(M}^\\dagger\\term{)^*}\n\\\\\t      \\term{0}^\\dagger &=& \\term{0}\n\\end{array}\n\\qquad\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\t(\\term{M + N})^\\dagger &=& \\term{M}^\\dagger \\, \\term{+} \\, \\term{N}^\\dagger\n\\\\\t    \\term{[t]a}^\\dagger &=& \\term{a<t>}\n\\\\\t    \\term{a<t>}^\\dagger &=& \\term{[t]a}\n\\\\\t (\\term{Ex.M})^\\dagger &=& \\term{Ex.M}^\\dagger\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\\end{definition}\n\nWe shall see throughout the paper how various operational,  equational,  and semantic notions either dualize or respect duality. \n\n\n% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Operational semantics\n\n\\subsection{Operational Semantics} \n\nThe small-step operational semantics is given by a stack machine, the \\emph{relational abstract machine} or \\emph{relational machine}.\n\n\\begin{definition}[Relational Machine]\nA \\emph{state} is a triple $({S_A},\\term M,K)$ of: a \\emph{memory} $S_A$, a family of stacks indexed in a set of locations $A$; a term $\\term M$; and a \\emph{continuation stack} $K$.

We abbreviate $\\val{f(t_1,\\dots,t_n)}$ to $\\val{f(T)}$ where $T=\\val{t_1\\dots t_n}$, and $\\term{[t_1]a;\\dots;[t_n]a}$ to $\\term{[T]a}$ and $\\term{a<t_n>;\\dots;a<t_1>}$ to $\\term{a<T>}$ (note the inversion). The \\emph{transitions} of the machine are given in Figure~\\ref{fig:machine}, read top--to--bottom, and are non-deterministic: a state transitions to a formal sum of states, represented by branching of the transitions. A \\emph{run} of the machine is a single rooted path in the machine tree, not necessarily to a leaf, shown with a double line as below. \n\\[\n\t\\run {S_A}MK {T_A}NL\n\\]\nA run is \\emph{successful} if it terminates in a state $\\mstate{T_A}*\\e$.

The big-step evaluation function $(\\eval{S_A}M)$ will collect these as a multiset. Since variables are global and machine steps substitute into the continuation stack, evaluation returns also a finite substitution map $\\sigma$ with each return memory $T_A$, as a pair $(T_A,\\sigma)$. In a composition $\\term{M;N}$, the subsitutions from $\\term M$ can then be applied to $\\term N$.\n\n\\paragraph{Notation}\nWe denote the empty multiset by $\\mempty$, a singleton by $\\msingle{(T_A,\\sigma)}$, and multiset union by $\\munion$. Substitution maps $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ are applied to a term as $\\term{\\sigma M}$ and composed as $\\term{(\\sigma\\tau)M}=\\term{\\sigma(\\tau M)}$. The empty map is $\\e$, and $\\restrict\\sigma \\val y$ is as $\\sigma$ except undefined on $\\val y$.

To start let\'s just discuss theoretically how I could add the other elements of the Kleene Algebra. \n\nI already have failure / 0 which is the symbol RCMFail.\n\nLet us ignore the Kleene-star thing for now since this looks complicated. That means we can also ignore the local variable binding introduced with the ∃x operation. \n\nWe can also set aside the locations and stateful effects. \n\nSo unless I\'m missing something the only thing we need to implement is the + operation. I\'m not sure how that works. \n\nLet\'s not write any typescript code yet. Conceptually, the sum operation has to branch the execution. My question is, when we branch the execution do we also need to branch the environment? I would guess so. \n\ni.e., [<x>;<y> + <x>;[x];[y]] \n\nHere, \n\nStep 1 - <x>\nwe pop a value and assign it to variable x\n\nStep 2 - <y> + <x>\nWe branch the environment and the stack and on the left side we pop the head of the stack and assign to y and on the right side we pop and assign to x again.\n\nSo the right side might fail if the head is not he same value already assigned to x, while the left side won\'t fail unless the stack is empty. \n\nStep 3 and 4 - [x];[y]\n\nWe have to apply these in each branch that doesn\'t fail. \n\nAt the end do we return a set of values? If multiple branches produce the same value do we de-duplicate them? If some branches fail but others succeed does our final output include the failure state or do we just ignore the failed branches as long as one branch produces a value?\n\nTry to answer these questions based on the content of the academic paper I posted above. \n\n',

Branching execution and environment:\nYes, you're correct that the '+' operation branches the execution. The paper defines the big-step operational semantics for 'M+N' as:\n\n(S_A ⇓ M+N) = (S_A ⇓ M) ⊔ (S_A ⇓ N)\n\nThis means that we evaluate both M and N independently on the input memory S_A, and then take the union of the results. So yes, we would need to branch both the environment and the stack.\n\n2. Handling failures:\nThe paper defines failure (0) as returning an empty multiset. In the big-step semantics, it's defined as:\n\nS_A ⇓ 0 = ∅\n\nThis suggests that failed branches are simply ignored. They contribute nothing to the final result set.\n\n3. Return values:\nThe evaluation function returns a multiset of pairs (T_A, σ), where T_A is the return memory and σ is a substitution map. This means:\n\n- We do return a set of values (more precisely, a multiset of memory states and substitutions).\n- Duplicate results are not de-duplicated (it's a multiset, not a set).\n- Failed branches are ignored (they contribute an empty multiset to the union).\n\n4. Deduplication:\nThe paper doesn't explicitly mention deduplication. Since it uses multisets, it appears that identical results from different branches are not deduplicated.\n\n5. Handling partial failures:\nAs mentioned, failed branches (those that evaluate to the empty multiset) are effectively ignored when we take the union of results. So if some branches fail but others succeed, the final output will only include the successful results.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The '+' operation does branch both the execution and the environment.\n- We return a multiset of results, potentially including duplicates.\n- Failed branches are ignored in the final result.\n- As long as at least one branch succeeds, we'll have a non-empty result, ignoring the failed branches.\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the non-deterministic, relational nature of the calculus, where multiple valid outputs are possible for a given input.",

The subscript A indicates that it's indexed by the set of locations A. Each location (a, b, c, etc.) represents a separate stack.\n\nSo, if you have locations a and b, T_A might look something like:\nT_A = { T_a, T_b }\nWhere T_a is the state of stack a, and T_b is the state of stack b after execution.\n\n2. σ (Substitution map):\nA substitution map is a function that maps variables to values. In the context of this calculus, it's used to keep track of variable assignments that occur during execution.\n\nFor example, if during execution we determine that x should be replaced with the value 5, our substitution map σ would include the mapping x → 5.\n\nThe reason for keeping this separate from the memory T_A is that these substitutions might need to be applied to future terms in the program.\n\n3. Big-step operational semantics:\nThe big-step semantics describe how to evaluate a complete term in one \"big step\". For each type of term, it defines how to compute the final result given an initial memory state.\n\nLet's look at an example from the paper:\n\nS_A ⇓ M;N = [(U_A, τσ) | (T_A, σ) ∈ S_A ⇓ M, (U_A, τ) ∈ T_A ⇓ σN]\n\nThis can be read as:\n\"To evaluate M;N starting with memory S_A:\n1. Evaluate M, getting a set of possible (T_A, σ) pairs.\n2. For each of these, apply σ to N and evaluate σN starting from T_A.\n3. For each result (U_A, τ) of this evaluation, combine the substitutions to get τσ.\n4. The final result is the set of all (U_A, τσ) pairs obtained this way.\"\n\nThis formulation allows for non-determinism (multiple possible outcomes) and carries forward both the final memory state and the accumulated substitutions.\n\nIn your TypeScript implementation, you might represent T_A as your RMCStack (or a collection of RMCStacks if you implement multiple locations), and σ as a Map<string, Value> where Value could be your actual values or Variables.",

Substitution Map vs. Environment:\nYour \"environment\" is indeed similar to a substitution map, but as you've realized, it's a bit more complex in the formal semantics of the RMC.\n\n2. Fresh Application of Substitutions:\nYou're absolutely right that we can't simply copy the whole environment/substitution map when branching. The paper's approach is more precise:\n\n- When we move from one expression to another (like in M;N), we apply the substitutions from M to N before evaluating N.\n- This ensures that only the relevant substitutions are carried forward.\n\n3. Scoping and New Variables:\nAs you noted, different branches or sub-expressions might introduce new variables or not use all previous variables. The formal semantics handles this by:\n\n- Only applying relevant substitutions.\n- Allowing new substitutions to be created in sub-expressions.\n- Combining substitutions carefully (like in the τσ in the M;N example).\n\n4. Implementation Considerations:\nIn a practical implementation, you might:\n\n- Keep a substitution map for each evaluation step.\n- When moving to a sub-expression, apply only the relevant substitutions.\n- After evaluating a sub-expression, combine its resulting substitutions with the previous ones, being careful about scoping.\n\n5. Branching and '+' Operation:\nFor the '+' operation, you'd evaluate each branch independently, each potentially producing its own set of (memory, substitution) pairs. The results are then combined (union of multisets).\n\nSo, in summary, your insight is correct. The formal semantics is designed to be very precise about how substitutions are applied and combined, which allows it to handle scoping and branching correctly. In an implementation, you'd need to carefully manage these substitutions to match the formal semantics.",

This aligns with the calculus's treatment of undefined variables.\n\n2. Chaining Substitutions:\nYour implementation correctly handles chains of variable substitutions. If a variable is defined as another variable, it recursively applies substitutions until it reaches either an undefined variable or a non-variable value. This is crucial for correctly implementing the semantics of the calculus.\n\n3. Type Safety:\nThe function maintains type safety by returning either a value of type T or a Variable.\n\n4.

Cycle Detection:\nWhile not strictly necessary for correctness (as the calculus doesn't specify behavior for cyclic definitions), you might want to add cycle detection for practical reasons.

Each function symbol has an associated arity (number of arguments it takes).\n\n3. f^n:\nIn the notation f^n, f is the name of a function symbol, and n is its arity (the number of arguments it takes).\n\n4. f^n ∈ Σ:\nThis means that f^n is a function symbol in the set Σ. For example, Σ might include symbols like:\n   - a^0 (a constant, takes no arguments)\n   - plus^2 (a binary function, takes two arguments)\n   - if_then_else^3 (a ternary function, takes three arguments)\n\n5. f^n(t_1,...,t_n):\nThis represents the application of the function symbol f^n to n arguments, where each t_i is itself an algebraic term.\n\nExamples:\n- If Σ includes a^0, then a() is a valid term.\n- If Σ includes plus^2, then plus(x, y) is a valid term, where x and y are variables or other terms.\n- A more complex term might look like: if_then_else(less_than(x, y), plus(x, 1), y)\n\nIn your implementation, you might represent these as:\n\n```typescript\ntype AlgebraicTerm =\n  | Variable\n  | { \n      type: "FunctionApplication";\n      functionSymbol: string;\n      args: AlgebraicTerm[];\n    }\n\n// Examples:\nconst a: AlgebraicTerm = { type: "FunctionApplication", functionSymbol: "a", args: [] };\nconst plus: AlgebraicTerm = { \n  type: "FunctionApplication", \n  functionSymbol: "plus", \n  args: [{ type: RMCVar, varName: "x" }, { type: RMCVar, varName: "y" }] \n};\n```\n\nThese algebraic terms allow the calculus to work with structured data, not just simple values.

Instead, they are part of the signature Σ, which is considered as given or predefined.\n\n2. No Implicit Lambda Functions:\nThere's no implicit appeal to lambda functions or any other form of function definition within the calculus. The calculus itself doesn't provide a mechanism for defining the behavior of these functions.\n\n3. Interpretation:\nThe actual interpretation or implementation of these functions is considered external to the calculus.

Unification:\nWhen the paper discusses unification later, it's about unifying these algebraic terms structurally, not about executing the functions they represent.\n\n6.

                text: "Excellent questions! Let's clarify these points about the stack operators in Definition 2.1:\n\n1. Meaning of 'a':\nIn the notation [t]a and a<t>, 'a' does not represent the stack itself. Instead, 'a' represents a location. In this calculus, there can be multiple stacks, each associated with a different location.\n\n2. Definition of Locations:\nThe paper mentions earlier: \"We assume a countable set of locations A = {a, b, c, ...}, which each represent a stack on the abstract machine.\"\n\n3. Multiple Stacks:\nThis means that the calculus allows for multiple stacks, each identified by a location (a, b, c, etc.). This is a generalization that allows the calculus to model various computational effects, as mentioned in the \"Locations\" paragraph of Section 1.3.\n\n4. Syntax of Stack Operations:\n- [t]a means \"push term t onto the stack at location a\"\n- a<t> means \"pop from the stack at location a and unify with term t\"\n\n5. Order of 'a':\nThe different positioning of 'a' in [t]a and a<t> is likely a notational choice to make the operations visually distinct and perhaps to suggest the direction of the operation (pushing onto 'a' vs. pulling from 'a').\n\n6. Syntactic Definition of Stacks:\nThe stacks themselves are not part of the syntax of terms in the calculus. They are part of the state of the abstract machine that evaluates these terms. The syntax only includes operations on these stacks.\n\n7. Abstract Machine State:\nThe state of the stacks is maintained by the abstract machine (defined later in the paper) as part of its configuration. In the machine, there's typically a component that represents the current state of all stacks, indexed by their locations.\n\nTo summarize:\n- 'a' is a location identifier, not the stack itself.\n- The calculus allows operations on multiple stacks, each identified by a location.\n- Stacks are not part of the syntax of terms, but are part of the state maintained by the abstract machine that evaluates these terms.\n- [t]a pushes to location a, while a<t> pops from location a.\n\nThis multi-stack approach allows the calculus to model more complex computational scenarios, like managing multiple data streams or different types of memory, all within a single framework.",

Importance of Different Locations:\nThe multiple locations (stacks) are an important feature of the Relational Machine Calculus, but their importance depends on what aspects of computation you're trying to model or implement.\n\n2. Purpose of Multiple Locations:\nAs mentioned in the paper (Section 1.3, \"Locations\" paragraph), these multiple stacks can be used to capture several computational effects:\n   - Mutable store (by restricting stacks to depth one)\n   - Input and output (as dedicated streams)\n   - Probabilistic generator (as a stream of random bits)\n   - Modeling stateful computations like Turing machines or Petri nets\n\n3. Not Primarily About Multi-threading:\nWhile multiple stacks could potentially be used to model some aspects of multi-threading, that doesn't seem to be the primary intention here. It's more about modeling different types of computational resources or effects within a single-threaded context.\n\n4. High-Level Implementation:\nIf you're implementing this in a high-level programming language and your goal is not to model these specific computational effects, you could simplify by using a single stack. However, keep in mind:\n\n   - You'd be implementing a subset of the full calculus.\n   - You might lose some expressive power, particularly for modeling certain effects.\n   - Some terms in the full calculus might not be directly representable in your simplified version.\n\n5. Considerations for Simplification:\nIf you decide to simplify:\n   - You could omit the location parameter from push and pop operations.\n   - Ensure that this simplification doesn't break any other parts of the calculus you're implementing.\n   - Be aware that some examples or properties described in the paper might not directly apply to your simplified version.\n\n6. Potential Middle Ground:\nA middle ground could be to implement the concept of locations, but start with just one default location. This would allow you to extend to multiple locations later if needed, without complicating your initial implementation.\n\nIn summary, while you can simplify by ignoring different stack locations for a basic implementation, it's important to recognize that this is a significant feature of the full calculus. If your goal is to fully implement the RMC as described in the paper, including its ability to model various computational effects, you should consider retaining the concept of multiple locations. However, if your primary goal is to understand and implement the core ideas of the calculus in a simplified context, starting with a single stack could be a reasonable approach.",

Kleene Star (M*)\n   - In the context of the Relational Machine Calculus, the Kleene star M* represents the non-deterministic repetition of M zero or more times.\n   - Operationally, it means that M can be executed any number of times (including zero).\n   - This introduces the possibility of infinite behavior and, crucially, the duplication of terms.\n\n2. Duplication and Variable Issues\n   - When M* duplicates a term M, it can lead to problems with variable identity and α-conversion (renaming of bound variables to avoid conflicts).\n   - For example, if M contains a variable x, repeating M multiple times could lead to conflicts or unintended variable captures.\n\n3. Variable Scope Operator (∃x.M)\n   - The ∃x.M operator (read as "exists x dot M" or "new x in M") is introduced to solve the problems arising from term duplication.\n   - It makes the scope of a variable explicit, creating a new, locally scoped variable x for use in M.\n\n4. Purpose of ∃x.M\n   - It ensures that each repetition of M in M* gets its own fresh copy of the variable x.\n   - This prevents unintended variable captures and makes the behavior of repeated terms well-defined.\n\n5. Relation to λ-calculus\n   - The paper notes that ∃x.M combined with pop (<x>) provides a proper decomposition of λ-abstraction:\n     λx.M = ∃x.(<x>;M)\n   - This shows how the RMC can encode λ-calculus while providing more fine-grained control over variable binding and stack operations.\n\n6. Why It\'s Needed with Kleene Star\n   - Without ∃x.M, repeating a term with free variables could lead to confusion about which instance of a variable is being referred to.\n   - With ∃x.M, each repetition effectively gets its own renamed version of x, avoiding conflicts.\n\nExample:\nConsider a term like (∃x.[x]a;<x>)*. This term can push and pop the same value repeatedly, with each iteration getting a fresh x. Without the ∃x, repeating [x]a;<x> could lead to confusion about which x is being referred to in each repetition.\n\nIn summary, the variable scope operator ∃x.M is introduced primarily to handle the complications arising from term duplication, especially in the context of the Kleene star operation. It provides a way to create locally scoped variables, ensuring that repeated terms behave consistently and avoiding issues with variable capture and identity across multiple iterations.',

Your example: (∃x.[x]a;<x>)*\n   - Your pseudocode interpretation is correct:\n     ```\n     while (true) {\n        let x\n        stack.push(x).pop(x)\n     }\n     ```\n   - This creates a fresh x each iteration, effectively pushing and popping an arbitrary new value each time.\n\n3.

Your example: (<x>;[x])*\n   - This is also a valid term.\n   - Your pseudocode and interpretation are correct:\n     ```\n     let x\n     while (true) {\n        stack.pop(x).push(x)\n     ```\n   - You're right that this version would only succeed if all values on the stack are the same (or unifiable with each other).\n\n5. Behavior differences:\n   - (∃x.<x>;[x])* : This would succeed for any stack, repeatedly popping and pushing arbitrary values.\n   - (<x>;[x])* : This would only succeed if the stack contains identical (or unifiable) values throughout.\n\n6. Global vs. Local Variables:\n   - Terms without ∃ use variables more like global variables or parameters.\n   - Terms with ∃ introduce new, locally scoped variables each time they're evaluated.\n\n7. Implications for Unification:\n   - In (<x>;[x])*, x acts like a pattern that must match consistently throughout the execution.\n   - In (∃x.<x>;[x])*, each iteration gets a fresh x, so it can match any value independently.\n\nYour understanding of the differences between these forms is spot-on. The choice between using ∃ or not depends on whether you want fresh variables each iteration (for arbitrary matching) or consistent variables across iterations (for pattern matching or maintaining state).",

Let\'s break down its practical uses and how it can be applied in terminating programs:\n\n1. Non-deterministic Repetition:\n   - M* doesn\'t necessarily mean "repeat M forever." It means "repeat M zero or more times."\n   - This includes the possibility of not executing M at all, executing it once, twice, or any number of times.\n\n2. Finite Executions:\n   - In practice, M* often terminates after a finite number of repetitions, either because:\n     a) The computation naturally reaches a point where it can\'t continue.\n     b) Some condition in M causes it to stop repeating.\n\n3. Practical Uses:\n\n   a) Searching and Backtracking:\n      - M* can be used to model search algorithms where you\'re trying different possibilities until you find a solution.\n      - If a solution is found, the execution can terminate naturally.\n\n   b) Parsing:\n      - In parsing applications, M* might represent "match this pattern zero or more times," which is a common operation.\n\n   c) Database Queries:\n      - In relational algebra contexts, M* could represent operations like transitive closure.\n\n   d) Protocol Modeling:\n      - M* can model protocols where a certain action is repeated until a condition is met.\n\n4. Termination Conditions:\n   - While not explicit in the M* notation, termination is often achieved by the nature of M itself or the context in which M* is used.\n   - For example, (∃x.<x>;[x]=0 + [x+1])* might represent counting up until we hit 0, at which point it naturally terminates.\n\n5. Finite vs. Infinite Behavior:\n   - The calculus allows for the expression of both finite and infinite behaviors.\n   - In many practical applications, you\'d use M* in a context where finite behavior is guaranteed or highly likely.\n\n6. Theoretical vs. Practical Implementation:\n   - In a theoretical context, M* represents all possible repetitions, including infinite ones.\n   - In a practical implementation, you might add mechanisms to limit or control the number of iterations.\n\n7. Example of Practical Use:\n   ```\n   (∃x.<x>; (x=0 + (process(x); [x-1])))* ; [success]\n   ```\n   This could represent processing items until we run out (x reaches 0), then signaling success. It will terminate when x becomes 0.\n\n8. Relation to Logic Programming:\n   - The * operator in RMC is similar to recursive predicates in logic programming languages like Prolog, where termination depends on the data and the specific rules defined.\n\nIn summary, while M* can represent infinite behavior, its practical use often involves finite repetitions that terminate based on the nature of M or the context in which M* is used. The power of M* lies in its ability to express complex, potentially recursive behaviors succinctly, while still allowing for practical, terminating computations in many cases.',

The '+' operation means that at each step, the computation branches into two possibilities:\n   - One branch attempts to pop and discard a value matching x from stack 'a'.\n   - The other branch pops any value from 'a' and pushes it to 'b'.\n\n2. This branching happens at every iteration of the Kleene star, potentially leading to many different computation paths.\n\n3. The result is not a single deterministic outcome, but rather a set of possible outcomes, each representing a different way the non-deterministic choices could have been made.\n\nImplications:\n\n1. Some branches of computation may fail (e.g., when trying to pop x but the top of the stack doesn't match).\n\n2. We may end up with multiple successful computations, each with a different final state of the stacks.\n\n3. The term doesn't guarantee that all instances of the head value are removed; it allows for any number of them to be removed, including none or all.\n\nGiven this, the term doesn't actually solve the original problem deterministically. It represents a more general, non-deterministic computation that includes the desired behavior as one of its possible outcomes.\n\nTo solve the original problem deterministically within the constraints of the calculus, we would need a different approach, possibly involving more complex term structures or additional stack operations to enforce the desired behavior.\n\nThank you for this crucial observation.

Using ★ for the unit and * for the Kleene star is an excellent idea for clarity.\n\nRegarding your question about what causes a Kleene * term to terminate, let's clarify:\n\n1. Termination of Kleene Star:\n   - The Kleene star M* represents zero or more repetitions of M.\n   - It doesn't inherently terminate; rather, it allows for any number of repetitions, including zero.\n\n2. Role of ★ (Unit):\n   - ★ represents a successful computation that does nothing.\n   - It doesn't directly cause termination of a Kleene star operation.\n\n3. Actual Termination Mechanisms:\n   a. Failure: If M fails (e.g., a pop operation on an empty stack), that branch of computation ends.\n   b. Non-determinism: The + operator allows for branches where M is not executed (effectively terminating that branch's repetition).\n   c. Resource Exhaustion: In practical terms, when operating on finite stacks, repetitions may naturally end when the stack is empty.\n\n4. Example of Termination:\n   Consider (a<x>; ★ + ★)*\n   - This can terminate after any number of pops from stack 'a', including zero.\n   - It terminates when either the stack is empty (a<x> fails) or non-deterministically chooses the right branch (★).\n\n5. Infinite vs. Finite Behavior:\n   - Theoretically, M* includes the possibility of infinite repetition.\n   - In practice, with finite resources (like stack contents), repetitions often naturally terminate.\n\n6. Controlled Termination:\n   To ensure termination, you typically structure M to include conditions that will eventually fail or use the + operator to provide termination paths.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question: ★ itself doesn't cause a Kleene * term to terminate. Termination in practical uses comes from:\n1. The structure of M (e.g., operations that will eventually fail)\n2. Non-deterministic choices (via +) that allow for termination\n3. Exhaustion of the resources M is operating on (e.g., empty stacks)\n\nIn designing terms with Kleene *, you need to consider how these factors will interact to produce the desired behavior, including appropriate termination.",

Either the comptutation doesn't terminate so there is no output, or all the iteration branches fail so we don't get an output. \n\nI think I just figured out the answer to my own question. \n\nOnce all * branches fail the stacks are in a certain state which may be different as a result of the operations that occured during iteration. In this model, there isn't a distinction between state and output. Basically, whatever state the stacks are in after the computation stops is considered to be the output. \n\nExcept that can't be quite right, because earlier we discussed the idea that there is output which is a multiset of stacks.

Termination and Output:\nYou're correct that termination in the context of a Kleene star often involves failure in some branches. However, this doesn't mean we don't get output. Your intuition about the state of the stacks being the output is partially correct.\n\n2. Non-determinism and Multiple Outputs:\nThe key here is non-determinism. A term with a Kleene star doesn't produce just one output, but potentially many.\n\n3. Multiset of Results:\nAs you recalled, the output of a computation in the Relational Machine Calculus is indeed a multiset of results. Each result in this multiset represents a possible outcome of the computation.\n\n4. Successful Computations:\nA computation is considered successful if it reaches a state where no more reductions are possible and the term has been fully evaluated (often to the unit ★).\n\n5. How * Works with Output:\nWhen we have a term M*, it represents all possible numbers of repetitions of M, including zero. Each of these possibilities can lead to a different final state, and each successful path contributes to the multiset of results.\n\n6. Example:\nConsider a term like: a<x>; ([x]b; ★ + ★)*; [done]a\n\nThis might produce a multiset of results like:\n- {(a:[done], b:[]), (a:[done], b:[v]), (a:[done], b:[v,v]), ...}\nWhere v is the value popped from a.\n\n7. Termination Without Failure:\nNote that in the example above, the * can \"terminate\" without failure by choosing the right branch (★) of the +. This allows for successful computations with different numbers of repetitions.\n\n8. Output vs. State:\nWhile the final state of the stacks is indeed crucial, the \"output\" of the calculus is more than just this final state. It's the collection of all possible final states that can be reached through successful computations.\n\n9. Big-Step Semantics:\nThe paper defines a big-step operational semantics (Definition 2.1) that formalizes how to collect these multiple possible outcomes into a multiset.\n\nIn summary, you're right that the state of the stacks after computation is key, but the full picture involves considering all possible successful computation paths. The output is not a single final state, but a multiset of all reachable final states, each representing a possible outcome of the non-deterministic computation.\n\nThis approach allows the calculus to model non-deterministic and relational computations, where a single input might correspond to multiple possible outputs.",

Structure of Each Element:\n   Each element in the multiset is a pair (S_A, σ), where:\n   - S_A is the final state of all stacks (in this case, stacks a and b)\n   - σ is a substitution map (representing any variable bindings that occurred during the computation)\n\n2. Content of the Multiset:\n   The multiset will contain:\n   - All possible final states resulting from the execution of M\n   - All possible final states resulting from the execution of N\n\n3. Example Representation:\n   Let's represent it more concretely. The multiset might look like this:\n\n   {\n     ({a: [v1, v2, ...], b: [w1, w2, ...]}, σ1),  // A possible result from M\n     ({a: [x1, x2, ...], b: [y1, y2, ...]}, σ2),  // Another possible result from M\n     ({a: [p1, p2, ...], b: [q1, q2, ...]}, σ3),  // A possible result from N\n     ({a: [r1, r2, ...], b: [s1, s2, ...]}, σ4)   // Another possible result from N\n   }\n\n   Where v1, v2, w1, w2, etc., represent the final contents of stacks a and b in different possible outcomes, and σ1, σ2, etc., represent the corresponding substitution maps.\n\n4. Characteristics:\n   - The multiset contains all results from both M and N.\n   - If M or N are deterministic, they might contribute only one result each.\n   - If M or N are non-deterministic, they might contribute multiple results each.\n   - The multiset allows for duplicates, so if M and N can produce the same final state, it might appear multiple times.\n\n5. Substitution Maps:\n   The substitution maps (σ) keep track of any variable bindings that occurred during the computation. They're crucial for maintaining consistency across term evaluations, especially in more complex expressions.\n\nIn summary, for M + N with two stack locations a and b, the resulting multiset is a collection of all possible final states of both stacks, paired with their corresponding substitution maps, resulting from the execution of both M and N.

Structure in the Paper:\nLooking back at the paper, specifically Definition 2.1 (Big-step operational semantics), the evaluation function (⇓) is defined to return a multiset.\n\n3.

Multiset Structure:\n   Implement a multiset where each element is a pair (T_A, σ), where T_A represents the final state of all stacks and σ is the substitution map.\n\n2.

Check if an identical (T_A, σ) pair already exists in the multiset.\n     b. If it exists, increment its count.\n     c. If it doesn't exist, add it to the multiset with a count of 1.\n\n3.

Other Operations:\n   For operations other than '+', you'll typically just be adding new results to the multiset or manipulating existing ones.\n\n6. Kleene Star (*) Considerations:\n   For Kleene star operations, you might end up with multiple successful branches, each potentially contributing to the multiset.\n\n7. Efficiency Consideration:\n   Depending on the complexity of your terms, you might want to implement an efficient data structure for quick equality checking and insertion into the multiset.\n\n8.
